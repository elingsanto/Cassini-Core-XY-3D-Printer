# Cassini-Core-XY-3D-Printer
This is the configuration I used for my DIY Cassini Core XY 3D Printer
Please do you homework before directly uploading this file to your.
RUN OUT SENSOR IS DISABLED! If you care about your health, enable RUN OUT SENSOR PROTECTION
You will probably need to adjust E-steps, temperatures and LCD screens, and auto-leveling configurations to make it work properly.
Enjoy and Happy Printing!
